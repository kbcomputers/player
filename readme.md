# What is @kbco/player?

Well it's a way to simply serve and play videos from your computer.

## Why?
Because I'm lazy... I have a chromebook... and I wanted videos to autoplay... 

## How to use?

Install it to your computer with...
```
npm install -g @kbco/player
```
Once installed

```
kbco-player start <dir_name> <port>
```

The directory name is required, and the port is not required. The directory name is the directory it's searching through to gather the videos.

The port is optional, but defaults to 3000. This is the port you access the program from.
